# 🕸️ Article Web Scraping Project

This project is a Python-based web scraper designed to extract structured information from online articles.

- Fetch article content from the web  
- Parse and extract specific data (tables, text, lists, etc.)  
- Store extracted data in **Excel files**  
- Expose the results through a **REST API endpoint**

This repository was created as part of the *Python Web Scraping Series*.
